### Maximum Triplet Sum

Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array without duplicates .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .
Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives, negatives also zeros .
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Example:

`maxTripletSum ([-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29]) ==> return 41`

Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum [12 , 29 , 0] in order , their sum is 41 ,
Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .
