numPrimorial (3) ==> return 30
```
Since the passed number is (3) ,Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Mathematically written as , P3# = 30 .

```javascript
numPrimorial (5) ==> return 2310
```
Since the passed number is (5), Then the primorial should obtained by multiplying 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310. Mathematically written as , P5# = 2310.
