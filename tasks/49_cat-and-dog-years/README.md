### Cats and Dogs years

have a cat and a dog.
I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.
Return their respective ages now as [humanYears, catYears, dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1

Cat Years

15 cat years for first year

+9 cat years for second year

+4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years

15 dog years for first year

+9 dog years for second year

+5 dog years for each year after that


```javascript
function humanCatDogYears(humanYears) {
  // Your code here!
  return [0,0,0];
}
```

Test suits:

humanYearsCatYearsDogYears(1) shoud return [1, 15, 15];

humanYearsCatYearsDogYears(2) should return [2, 24, 24];

humanYearsCatYearsDogYears(10) should return [10, 56, 64];
