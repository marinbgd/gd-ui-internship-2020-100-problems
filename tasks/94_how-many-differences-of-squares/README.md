### How Many Differences of Squares?

Some numbers can be expressed as a difference of two squares, for example, 20 = 62-42 and 21 = 52-22. Many numbers can be written this way, but not all.
Complete the function that takes a positive integer n and returns the amount of numbers between 1 and n (inclusive) that can be represented as the difference of two perfect squares.
Note: Your code should be able to handle n values up to 45000

Test suits:

squares(4) should return 3;

squares(5) should return 4;

squares(10) should return 7;

squares(20) should return 15;

squares(6427) should return 4820;
