### N smallest elements in original order
Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame bas sorting method there) with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number n of smallest elements to return.
Also:
the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the array length;
elements can be duplicated;
in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).

Same examples and more in the test cases:
`firstNSmallest([1,2,3,4,5],3) // return [1,2,3]`
