### Factorize number

Return the factorial of the provided integer.
If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!
For example: `5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`
