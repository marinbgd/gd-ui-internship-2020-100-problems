### Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers


Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.
The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

```javascript
function sumFibs(num) {
  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);
```
