### Reverse string in range

Given a string and two indexes. Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive. Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only.
Example:
`reverseStringInRange("codewars",[1,5])` //return "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
`reverseStringInRange("cODEWArs", [1,5])` //return "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
